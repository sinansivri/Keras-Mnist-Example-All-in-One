# Keras-Mnist-Example-All-in-One

  Here is an a copy of fchollet's work with a slight adjustment for my old notebook to train mnist data on cpu(i3 4005U). Training time pretty long compared to original example.
  I also add a pretrained model (which was trained for 8 epochs on a shallower net than original example)
